            Ana is a professional and non-enthusiast who needs to purchase a
            plug-and-play PC that matches her professional working environment
            because she values aesthetics, is nervous to build a computer
            herself, and is unsure about which components offer the best
            price-performance and quality of life.

            Emma is a pc-enthusiast who needs to purchase a stand-alone computer

          <p>
            Ana needs an e-commerce website that allows her to configure a

            best value for her individual budget.

            The e-commerce website will let users configure a PC from a curated
            list of components which will affect non-enthusiasts by helping to
            narrow their options to the best value and quality of life
            components within their budget and hardware requirements as well as
            take care of the build and set up process for them. Effectiveness
            will be measured by amount of PC's sold.
          </p>
          <p>
            The e-commerce website will let users purchase, view large product
            images, and see detailed specifications of the computer case which
            will affect consumers building or upgrading their computer by
            offering them an aesthetic and performance focused case.
            Effectiveness will be measured by amount of cases sold.

            Insights: The interface should prioritize a clean, spacious layout,
            minimizing unnecessary elements or an overload of product SKUs to
            streamline user tasks and enhance efficiency. High-quality imagery,
            video, and interactive animations should be incorporated to elevate
            the visual design, strengthen branding, and enrich the user
            experience. Additionally, large product images and comprehensive
            specifications are essential to provide users with clear, detailed
            information about the product they are purchasing.

        <h3>Sitemap</h3>
        <p class="description">
          The sitemap was designed to streamline navigation, minimize the number
          of pages, enhance discoverability, reduce clicks, prioritize key user
          flows, and eliminate the need for a mobile drop-down menu. The Figma
          design file is linked in the next section for reference.

        <h3>High-Fidelity Prototypes</h3>
        <p class="description">
          The goal was to create mockups that are usable, aesthetics-driven, and
          focused on user flow. These mockups prioritize clarity and conciseness
          while maintaining a professional and elegant appearance to resonate
          with the target audience. The sites navigation and homepage
          prioritizes the two key user flows of purchasing a case and
          configuring a computer.

            Continuous iteration and incremental improvements overtime lead to
            an end product that is both more usable and aesthetic.

            The Competitive Analysis could be enhanced by including stand-alone
            PC case pages from brands like NZXT, Corsair, as well as other
            manufacturers that focus solely on cases, without offering prebuilt
            PCs or PC building services. Additionally, incorporating businesses
            that specialize in a single or limited range of products would
            provide valuable insights.
