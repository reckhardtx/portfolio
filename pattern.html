          The benefits of creating a design system and stickersheet of
          components and variants early on in a project materialize as a project

          PC case pages on NZXT, Corsair, and other case manufacturers who do
          not offer prebuilt PC's or a PC building service. Businesses who offer
          a single or limited amount of products would have also been beneficial
          additions.
