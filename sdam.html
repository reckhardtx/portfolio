        <div class="info-container">
          <h3>Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            Design a responsive website for a conceptual public art museum to
            advertise exhibitions and events, provide museum information, and
            enable patrons to schedule visits.
          </p>
          <h3>Audience</h3>
          <p>
            San Diego residents and visitors, ranging from individuals, couples,
            families, and groups of friends, to school and work groups. It
            caters to people with an interest in art, as well as those simply
            looking for an engaging activity to enjoy alone or with others.
          </p>

          <p>
            Create a responsive website that prioritizes intuitive user task
            flows and a minimalist, aesthetic design. The goal is to provide
            users with an effective and enjoyable experience while positioning
            SDAM as a trendy and engaging place.

            Completing a comprehensive high-fidelity mockup of the homepage
            before developing a design system or working on additional pages
            helps concentrate design efforts. This approach facilitates testing
            and validating visual design elements in a single, real context,
            ensuring their effectiveness before broader implementation.
