          <h3>Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            Design a responsive website for EP Analytics, a San Diego-based
            company specializing in high-performance computing solutions and
            expertise.
          </p>
          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
            At MiraCosta College, I was nominated by my professors for a student
            internship with EP Analytics and California Community Colleges. The
            internship initially focused on cybersecurity, later shifting to a
            UI redesign of the company website. I started this phase by
            conducting a brief questionnaire and interview, followed by
            presenting a design rationale for approval, citing successful
            real-world examples. Once approved, I created high-fidelity homepage
            mockups in Adobe XD. Due to time constraints, I focused on the
            homepage and began researching site builders. After thorough
            testing, I recommended transitioning the company's site from
            WordPress to Webflow for its superior customization options,
            eliminating the need for numerous third-party plugins and reducing
            complexity. I completed the internship with a developed homepage,
            and EP Analytics hired me on contract to finish the site's design
            and development. Throughout the process, I worked closely with EP
            Analytics' excellent leadership team.
